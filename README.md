# How to read source code

### Why itâ€™s important

1. Most of your time will be spent reading, not writing.
2. Simulates working at a company or open source project.
3. It's the fastest way to learn and improve.
4. Learn how to ignore large parts of a codebase and get a piece-by-piece understanding.

### Before you start

1. Read the docs (if they exist).
2. Run the code.
3. Play with the code to see how it behaves.
4. Think about how the code might be implemented.
5. Get the code into an editor so that you can modify it.
6. Look at the file structure.

### The process

1. Get a sense for the vocabulary.
2. Make note of any unfamiliar concepts that you might need to research later.
3. Do a quick read-through without diving into concepts from #2.
4. Test one feature with the debugger.
5. Document and add comments to confusing areas.
6. Research items in #2 only if required.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 if you want to understand more.

### Next level

1. Replicate parts of the app by hand (in the console).
2. Make small changes and see what happens.
3. Add a new feature.
